# FoLoKe's simple youtube downloader

For now this project is a starting point for a Flutter application with plugins needed to download and store.
- to use you need to change value of field "ext.kotlin_version" for "ext_storage" plugin for latest one version of installed Kotlin in its gradle.build 
(probably located somewhere \flutter\.pub-cache\hosted\pub.dartlang.org\ext_storage-1.0.3\android\build.gradle) 
or simply use another way to find Downloads folder on your Android device ("String path" variable)
